> Cihangir Bozdogan's portfolio website

A simple complete JamStack site. Hugo is a static site generator written in Go and it is very fast. Not much loading time or build time, fun to play with. Maybe not Hugo but the Hugo templates are very opinionated, it doesn't allow you to rename or relocate the files.
