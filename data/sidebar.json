    "description": "Hybrid Web Developer & Designer based in LONDON. Nowadays, mostly focused on development, but I like to explore new visual trends. 7 years of expertise in programming and over 9 years of experience in design. I have academic knowledge and hands-on practical experience in developing designs for modern websites. My hybrid approach means I am an asset for creating designs, coding those designs in a framework like Vue/React, and determining the feasibility of designs on a technical level.",
